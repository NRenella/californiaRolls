<p>In this code we simulate having to tend a garden with flowers trees and shrubs.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: flowers start at 4 days untrimmed so that the user can see an untended plant
           tree also starts at 2 days untrimmed and shrubs starts at 1 day unfertilized </P>
It will take count of what day it is and if a plant hasnt been tended to for three days it will give you a warning
After tending to it, it will continue with a day and you have to balance which plant you tend too
